Angular is a popular open-source JavaScript framework for building web applications. It's maintained by Google and a community of developers. Here are some key things to know about Angular:

TypeScript: Angular is built using TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. This helps catch errors during development and improves code maintainability.

Component-Based Architecture: Angular applications are built using a component-based architecture. Components are the building blocks of the application and can be thought of as self-contained units that encapsulate HTML templates, styles, and logic.

Two-Way Data Binding: Angular supports two-way data binding, which means changes to the application state are automatically reflected in the user interface, and vice versa.

Dependency Injection: Angular uses a powerful dependency injection system to manage dependencies and make it easy to test components in isolation.

Directives: Angular provides a range of directives that allow you to extend HTML with custom behavior. Common directives include ngIf, ngFor, and ngModel.
